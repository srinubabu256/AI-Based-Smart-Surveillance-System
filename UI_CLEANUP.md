# 🎨 UI UPDATE: CLEAN PROFESSIONAL SIDEBAR

## ✅ Request Addressed
You requested a **"normal"** look with **"normal text size"** and a **"normal background color"**, favoring a **"best proper view"**.

## ✨ Changes Implemented

I have completely refreshed the sidebar to be **Clean, Bright, and Professional**:

1.  **Background**:
    *   Switched from Dark Mode/Gradient to **Clean White**.
    *   Added a subtle right border for separation.

2.  **Typography (Text)**:
    *   **Increased Size**: Moved from small text to standard `text-base` size.
    *   **Colors**: Used clear high-contrast `gray-900` (black) and `gray-600` for excellent readability.
    *   **Weight**: applied `font-medium` and `font-bold` to make text stand out clearly.

3.  **Navigation Items**:
    *   **Active State**: Now uses a light blue background (`bg-blue-50`) with blue text (`text-blue-700`) - a standard industry pattern for selected items.
    *   **Hover State**: Subtle light gray hover effect (`bg-gray-50`).
    *   **Layout**: `Flex` layout with proper spacing (`py-3`) so items aren't cramped.

4.  **Header & Footer**:
    *   **Header**: Clean white background, bold "Sentinel" title.
    *   **Footer**: Distinct light gray section (`gray-50`) for the User Profile and Theme Toggle, separating it from the main navigation.

## 🚀 Result
The application now looks like a **standard, high-quality enterprise tool**. It is easy on the eyes, highly readable, and professional.
